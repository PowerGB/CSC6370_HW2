PS: I checked validator, which showed me a error about the link of font-family, the name is "Pinyon Script". I know it says the space between "Pinyon" and "Script" is illegle in validator, but I have to use a space to locate the font family in google css file. Certainly, if I comment the link or delete the space, it works, but the font-family doesn't work.
